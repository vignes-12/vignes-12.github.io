## About Me

Hello everyone! My name is Obblivignes KanchanadeviVenkataraman (you can call me Vignes KV
in short), and I am a first-year PhD student at North Carolina State University. I am currently
being advised jointly by Dr. Dongkuan Xu of the Computer Science department and Dr. Yang Zhang 
of the Textiles department. My current research has been focused on applying machine learning
techniques towards computer vision, and specifically in the single-molecule microscopy imaging
domain. These include utilizing Monte Carlo simulations towards spectroscopic and spatial image 
denoising, U-Net-based denoising techniques such as spatial attention and diffusion networks,
and developing a robust and end-to-end multi-agent system framework for microscopy analysis.
You can find a brief overview of each project and publication in my resume/CV below.

### Hobbies 
During my time off, I participate in several hobbies, including playing chess and video games,
swimming, hiking, and just relaxing with my friends.
